# Understanding Data Analytics
Data analytics in simple terms is about understanding data by extracting useful information from it. It's a fascinating field that makes sense of the past and provides mechanisms to make valuable predictions about the future. The data analytics process involves *collecting, organising, analysing, and transforming* data into useful information, which drives decision-making. 

Analytical thinking is about identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organised, step-by-step manner (Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate: [Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data?specialization=google-data-analytics)).

## üìä Different Types of Analytics
There are 4 main types of analytics that are specific to the respective needs of the data.
|Analytics Type   | Description                           |
|:---------------:|:--------------------------------------|
|Descriptive | It's the simplest analytics form that uses historical data to understand patterns. It does not change anything; it simply aggregates (summarises) and mines the data. The information can then be shared and visualised for further use. |
|Diagnostic | It searches for the **root** cause (the *why*) of behaviours using historical data. This type of analysis tries to understand the cause and correlation between different variables, using data discovery, probability, and regression analysis. |
|Predictive | Attempts to predict future outcomes from historical data using statistical and machine learning techniques. |
|Prescriptive | Uses AI, Algorithms, and Machine Learning to provide actions to be taken from the outcomes of predictive analysis. |
