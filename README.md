# Understanding Data Analytics
Data analytics in simple terms is about understanding data by extracting useful information from it. It's a fascinating field that makes sense of the past and provides mechanisms to make valuable predictions about the future. The data analytics process involves *collecting, organising, analysing, and transforming* data into useful information, which drives decision-making. 

Analytical thinking is about identifying and defining a problem and then solving it by using data in an organised, step-by-step manner (Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate: [Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-data?specialization=google-data-analytics)). A data analyst must have the relevant soft skills: communication, curiosity, problem solving, and creativity.

## üìä Different Types of Analytics
There are 4 main types of analytics that are specific to the respective needs of the data.
|Analytics Type   | Description                           |
|:---------------:|:--------------------------------------|
|Descriptive | It's the simplest analytics form that uses historical data to understand patterns. It does not change anything; it simply aggregates (summarises) and mines the data. The information can then be shared and visualised for further use. |
|Diagnostic | It searches for the **root** cause (the *why*) of behaviours using historical data. This type of analysis tries to understand the cause and correlation between different variables, using data discovery, probability, and regression analysis. |
|Predictive | Attempts to predict future outcomes from historical data using statistical and machine learning techniques. |
|Prescriptive | Uses AI, Algorithms, and Machine Learning to provide actions to be taken from the outcomes of predictive analysis. |

## ‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí• The Data Analysis Process
There are different approaches that one can take when performing analytics. The following are the 5 most typical steps involved in a data analysis project:
1. üß© Understand the Problem: Know why you are performing an analysis use the follwing as guides:
     - Have a clear definition of the issue or problem to be solved;
     - Know the type of problem: prediction, categorising, pattern finding, and so on;
     - Create a hypothesis to test
     - Helpful Questions to ask:
         - What type of results is needed?
         - Who are the results for?
         - When should the project be completed?
2. üì¶ Collect and Prepare the Data: Focus on collecting the relevant data from different relevant sources:
     - Types of Data Sources:
         - Primary or internal data: data that may be readily available from within an organisation;
         - Secondary data: customised data from outside sources;
         - Tertiary data: compiled sources of secondary data
     - Ensure that the data is reliable, original, comprehensive, current, and cited
     - Decide on which format the data should be collected in such as .csv,.txt,.xls, or .json
3. üßπClean the Data: Ensure that the data has integrity (accurate, trustworthy, complete, and consitent)
     - Involves dealing with missing values, changing data types and structures, taking random samples for analysis, and removing duplicates
4. üîé Analyze the Data: The acutal understanding of the data and using the correct techniques to solve the problem.
5. üñºÔ∏è Visualise and Share the Data: Create different graphs and visuals to represent the findings of the analysis. Select the correct tool to share the findings with those that need it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Analysis Techniques
There are two types of data: quantitative and qualitative. __Quantitative__ data is data that can be measured (numerical), while __qualitative__ data is data that describes the characteristics of an object. Both types of data have there respective methods.
### Quantitative Techniques
1. Cluster Analysis: aka segmentation or taxonomy analysis is about grouping data into different segments or clusters based on their similarities (homogenous). It is used to find hidden patterns within data.
2. Regression Analysis: Mainly used in predictive analysis to understand the correlation betwwen variables and not the *cause and effect*. It looks at the other factors (independent variables) that may have a relationship with the dependent variable/s.
3. Monte Carlo Simulation: using different scenarios to arrive at a desired outcome.
4. Tine Series Analysis: identifies trends of a variable over time.
5. Cohort Analysis: places data into categories based on similarities and analyses the groups over time.

### Qualitative Techniques
1. Content Analysis: focuses on the frequency of categorical data and the meaning of its context. Can also be used with quantitative data.
2. Sentiment Analysis: evaluates the emotional tone from textual data. A great technique for dealing with customer satisfaction.
3. Thematic Analysis: groups qualitative data into categories based on the frequency that they appear.
4. Grounded Tehory Analysis: creates a hypothesis from the data that was collected and analysed.
5. Discourse Analysis: aims to understand the meaning behind data that is not quantitative.

## Data Analysis Tools
There are numerous tools that can be used in data analysis. The following are some key tools:
- Speadheets: Micorsoft and Google Sheets
- SQL: Structured Query Language for working with databases
- Visualisation Tools: Power BI and Tableau to make static or dynamic visuals
- Programming Languages: Python and R along with relevant libraries like pandas, ggplot, and seaborn are the main programming languages used.
