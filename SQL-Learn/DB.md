A database management system is a type of software that allows users to interact with the data. There are numerous types of DBMS but the two most popular types are Relational DBMS and NoSQL DBMS.

### Normalisation
Database normalisation is the process of organizing data into tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves breaking down
